Deployed here : [The Underground App](https://theunderground.netlify.com/) 


This app was built to accompany the [Iron Summer 2018](http://www.andienguyen.com/p/iron-summer-2018-program.html) powerlifting program created by Andie Nguyen.

Iron Summer is a RPE (Rate of Percieved Exersion) based powerlifting program. 

RPE programs differ from convetional lifting programs by basing a workout on a user's max lift every day rather than their recorded max. It does ask for lifters to make frequent calculations.

This app makes it easy!

## Features
- User can create a user.
- User can log lifts for each day.
- User can receive workouts based on their daily lifts.

Coming soon:
- User can view their lift progrss on a graph.
- User can upload videos for coaches to critique form.
- User can calculate Macros for their diet.
- User can recieve daily tips on wellness.

## How to use?
Users will be able to register/log in and immediately start their workout. After submitting heaviest lift for the day, a workout will be generated to provide suggested amounts to lift.

Users new to lifting are expected to be following along with recommendations by a coach or instructor at the gym for best practices regard form, safety and nutrition.
