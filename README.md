## The Underground

This app was built to accompany the [Iron Summer 2018](http://www.andienguyen.com/p/iron-summer-2018-program.html) powerlifting program created by Andie Nguyen.

Iron Summer is a RPE (Rate of Percieved Exersion) based powerlifting program. 

RPE programs differ from convetional lifting programs by basing a workout on a user's max lift every day rather than their recorded max. It does ask for lifters to make frequent calculations.

This app makes it easy!

## Features
User can create a user.
User can log lifts for each day.
User can receive workouts based on their daily lifts.
